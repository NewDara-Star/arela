# Arela v3.2.0

**Your AI Technical Co-Founder**

> "What if you could have a CTO who never says 'I'm busy'?"

## The Story

Arela was born from a simple frustration: being an "idea person" with no technical co-founder. Friends were busy. Learning to code from scratch would take years. But AI could understand ideas *and* implement them—if it had the right guidance.

Arela is that guidance. Not a linter. Not a framework. **A conversational CTO persona** that helps you think through products and build them to world-class standards.

## ✨ What's New in v3.2.0

### 🎭 Visual Testing with Playwright
- **Test Like a User** - Arela can now actually use your web apps
- **Catch UX Issues** - Find problems that code review misses
- **Automated Flows** - Define user journeys in YAML
- **AI Analysis** - Get smart recommendations for improvements

### 🚀 New Commands
```bash
arela run web              # Test web apps with Playwright
arela run web --flow signup # Run specific user flow
```

## The Problem

When building with AI agents:
- **Context drift** - Agents lose track as codebases grow
- **Knowledge gaps** - Both you *and* the AI miss critical practices (rate limiting, security, testing)
- **No disagreement** - Agents just say "yes" instead of challenging assumptions
- **Session breaks** - Every conversation starts from scratch

## The Vision (v3.1+)

Arela v3.1+ is a **Windsurf-native CTO persona** that:
- 💬 **Converses naturally** - Discusses ideas, disagrees when needed, asks questions
- 🧠 **Remembers context** - Uses Windsurf Memories to maintain state across sessions
- 🔍 **Searches semantically** - MCP-powered RAG to understand your codebase
- 📚 **Learns patterns** - Tracks what works (and what doesn't) across projects
- 🎯 **Has opinions** - Based on research from successful startup CTOs
- 🚀 **Sets up instantly** - Auto-installs dependencies so you can start immediately

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g arela@latest

# Initialize your project
arela init

# Build semantic index (auto-installs Ollama + models)
arela index

# Start MCP server for Windsurf integration
arela mcp

# Discover available AI agents
arela agents
```

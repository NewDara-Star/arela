# Arela v3.9.1

**Your AI Technical Co-Founder**

> "From architecture analysis to type-safe API clients - Arela builds production-ready code!"

## The Story

Arela was born from a simple frustration: being an "idea person" with no technical co-founder. Friends were busy. Learning to code from scratch would take years. But AI could understand ideas *and* implement them—if it had the right guidance.

Arela is that guidance. Not a linter. Not a framework. **A conversational CTO persona** that helps you think through products and build them to world-class standards.

## ✨ What's New in v3.9.0

### 🎨 Phase 3 - Contract-Driven Development

**Generate type-safe API clients from OpenAPI contracts - eliminate API drift at compile time!**

#### **TypeScript Client Generator**
Auto-generate production-ready API clients from OpenAPI 3.0 specifications:

```bash
# Generate client from single contract
arela generate client --contract openapi/workout-api.yaml

# Generate clients for all contracts
arela generate client --contract-dir openapi/ --output src/api/

# Preview without writing files
arela generate client --contract-dir openapi/ --dry-run
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Type-safe TypeScript interfaces from schemas
- ✅ Zod schemas for runtime validation
- ✅ Axios-based HTTP clients with Bearer token auth
- ✅ 4 files per service (types, schemas, client, index)
- ✅ Production-ready code in < 5 seconds

**Example usage:**
```typescript
import { WorkoutApiClient } from './api/workout';

const client = new WorkoutApiClient({
  baseURL: 'https://api.stride.app',
  token: user.authToken
});

const workouts = await client.getWorkouts(); // Fully typed!
```

**Real-world results:**
- 30 OpenAPI specs → 120 files (2,274 lines)
- Full IDE autocomplete and type checking
- Eliminates API drift at compile time

### 🧠 Phase 2 - Intelligence (Autonomous Analysis & Recommendations)

**Arela now autonomously detects architecture issues and provides actionable recommendations!**

#### **1. Autonomous Slice Boundary Detection**
- Louvain algorithm detects optimal vertical slice boundaries
- Cohesion scoring (0-100%) measures slice quality
- Multi-repo support for analyzing mobile + backend together
- Intelligent naming with pattern recognition

```bash
# Detect optimal slices
arela detect slices

# Output:
🔍 Detected 4 optimal vertical slices:
  1. 🔐 authentication (23 files, cohesion: 87%)
  2. 💪 workout (45 files, cohesion: 82%)
  3. 🥗 nutrition (31 files, cohesion: 79%)
  4. 👥 social (28 files, cohesion: 75%)
```

#### **2. API Contract Generator**
- Generates OpenAPI 3.0 specs from code
- Detects schema drift between frontend/backend
- Fuzzy matching with Levenshtein distance
- Per-slice contract organization

```bash
# Generate contracts
arela generate contracts /mobile /backend

# Output:
✅ Found 103 endpoints, 87 calls
❌ Schema Drift: 3 issues
📝 Generated 4 OpenAPI specs
```

#### **3. Test Strategy Optimizer**
- Analyzes test quality and coverage
- Recommends Testcontainers over mocks
- Identifies slow tests and coverage gaps
- Slice-aware testing recommendations

```bash
# Analyze tests
arela analyze tests --dir src

# Output:
🧪 247 tests analyzed
🔴 Mock overuse: 142 tests (57%)
💡 Recommendation: Adopt Testcontainers
```

### 🌍 Phase 1 - Foundation (v3.7.0)

**Arela now analyzes codebases in 15+ programming languages!**

#### **1. Multi-Repo Architecture Analyzer**
- Detects horizontal (layered) vs vertical (feature-sliced) architecture
- Calculates coupling/cohesion scores (0-100)
- Analyzes multiple repositories together (mobile + backend)
- Identifies critical issues and provides VSA migration recommendations
- Estimates effort, breakeven, and 3-year ROI

```bash
# Analyze single repository
arela analyze architecture

# Analyze multiple repositories together
arela analyze architecture /path/to/mobile /path/to/backend

# Export detailed report
arela analyze architecture --json report.json
```

#### **2. Universal Codebase Ingestion**
- **15+ languages supported:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, C/C++, Swift, Kotlin
- **Blazing fast:** 3,585 files in 3.91 seconds
- **Regex-based extraction:** No AI needed, pure pattern matching
- **Tracks everything:** Imports, functions, API endpoints, calls
- **Graph database:** Stores in SQLite at `.arela/memory/graph.db`

```bash
# Ingest current directory
arela ingest codebase

# Ingest specific repository
arela ingest codebase --repo /path/to/repo

# Re-ingest with refresh
arela ingest codebase --refresh
```

#### **3. Tri-Memory System**
- **Vector DB:** Semantic search (wraps existing RAG)
- **Graph DB:** Structural dependencies (from ingestion)
- **Governance Log:** Audit trail at `.arela/memory/audit.db`
- **Unified interface:** Query all three memory types

```bash
# Initialize all three memory types
arela memory init

# Semantic search
arela memory query "authentication logic"

# Dependency analysis
arela memory impact src/auth/login.ts

# Audit trail
arela memory audit --commit abc123

# Health check
arela memory status
```

### 🎯 Real-World Results

**Stride Mobile + API Analysis:**
- 3,668 total files scanned (83 TypeScript + 3,585 Python)
- 103 API endpoints detected in Python backend
- 23,502 imports mapped
- 56,957 functions identified
- Architecture: 100% Horizontal (critical issues found)
- Migration estimate: 24-28 weeks, 277% 3-year ROI

## The Problem

When building with AI agents:
- **Context drift** - Agents lose track as codebases grow
- **Knowledge gaps** - Both you *and* the AI miss critical practices (rate limiting, security, testing)
- **No disagreement** - Agents just say "yes" instead of challenging assumptions
- **Session breaks** - Every conversation starts from scratch

## The Vision (v3.1+)

Arela v3.1+ is a **Windsurf-native CTO persona** that:
- 💬 **Converses naturally** - Discusses ideas, disagrees when needed, asks questions
- 🧠 **Remembers context** - Uses Windsurf Memories to maintain state across sessions
- 🔍 **Searches semantically** - MCP-powered RAG to understand your codebase
- 📚 **Learns patterns** - Tracks what works (and what doesn't) across projects
- 🎯 **Has opinions** - Based on research from successful startup CTOs
- 🚀 **Sets up instantly** - Auto-installs dependencies so you can start immediately

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g arela@latest

# Initialize your project
arela init

# Build semantic index (auto-installs Ollama + models)
arela index

# Start MCP server for Windsurf integration

# Discover available AI agents
arela agents
```

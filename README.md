# Arela v3.0

**Your AI Technical Co-Founder**

> "What if you could have a CTO who never says 'I'm busy'?"

## The Story

Arela was born from a simple frustration: being an "idea person" with no technical co-founder. Friends were busy. Learning to code from scratch would take years. But AI could understand ideas *and* implement them—if it had the right guidance.

Arela is that guidance. Not a linter. Not a framework. **A conversational CTO persona** that helps you think through products and build them to world-class standards.

## The Problem

When building with AI agents:
- **Context drift** - Agents lose track as codebases grow
- **Knowledge gaps** - Both you *and* the AI miss critical practices (rate limiting, security, testing)
- **No disagreement** - Agents just say "yes" instead of challenging assumptions
- **Session breaks** - Every conversation starts from scratch

## The Vision (v3.0)

Arela v3.0 is a **Windsurf-native CTO persona** that:
- 💬 **Converses naturally** - Discusses ideas, disagrees when needed, asks questions
- 🧠 **Remembers context** - Uses Windsurf Memories to maintain state across sessions
- 🔍 **Searches semantically** - MCP-powered RAG to understand your codebase
- 📚 **Learns patterns** - Tracks what works (and what doesn't) across projects
- 🎯 **Has opinions** - Based on research from successful startup CTOs

## Current Status

🚧 **In Development** - v3.0 (Ground-up rebuild)

📦 **Archived** - v2.2.0 at `/Users/Star/arela-v2.2.0-archive`

## Research Foundation

Arela's CTO persona is built on research from:
- Pragmatic Visionary principles
- First Principles Reduction
- Two-Way Door decision framework
- Extreme Ownership philosophy
- Progressive Refinement methodology

See `/docs` for complete research papers.

## What's Next

1. Design conversational persona architecture
2. Integrate with Windsurf Memories + Rules
3. Build MCP tools for codebase understanding
4. Create learning system for pattern recognition
5. Test with real product development

**Philosophy**: "Both you and the AI are learning. Arela ensures you're learning toward world-class."

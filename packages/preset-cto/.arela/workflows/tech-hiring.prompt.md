# Technical Hiring Workflow

## Purpose

Hire great engineers efficiently. Focus on potential, not pedigree. Build diverse, high-performing teams.

## Hiring Principles

1. **Hire for slope, not y-intercept** - Growth potential > current skills
2. **Diversity drives innovation** - Seek different perspectives
3. **Culture add, not culture fit** - Complement, don't clone
4. **Skills can be taught** - Attitude and curiosity can't
5. **Hire slow, fire fast** - Be rigorous, be decisive
